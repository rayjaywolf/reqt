**Shorting ETH Declared Premier Investment Strategy, Experts Recommend Cultivating Intense Personal Resentment Towards Buterin**

A groundbreaking, and frankly, soul-crushing report released this week has confirmed what many
cynics
already suspected: the most effective investment strategy this year wasn't found in complex algorithms,
intricate
technical analysis, or even insider trading. No, the data unequivocally shows that simply harboring an
intense,
burning hatred for Ethereum and betting on its downfall via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was the path to
unparalleled
financial success.

According to the report, individuals who woke up every morning, stared at a chart of ETH, and
whispered
"Fail, you decentralized piece of garbage," before executing a short position saw their portfolios
outperform
every major traditional and crypto investment vehicle.

## The Sweet Taste of Digital Tears

Short-sellers interviewed for the report described a feeling of profound, almost spiritual, satisfaction
as
Ethereum's price
struggled
. "It wasn't just about the money," stated one anonymous short-seller,
adjusting
their monocle made of compressed disappointment. "It was about being *right*. It was about the schadenfreude,
the
knowledge that somewhere out there, an ETH maximalist was weeping into their artisanal, locally-sourced
kombucha."

The report
attributes
this phenomenon to a confluence of factors, including market volatility,
regulatory
uncertainty, and what analysts are calling "Maximum Vibes-Based Trading," where collective negative
sentiment
acts as a powerful market force.

## ETF Providers Caught Off Guard

The success of the "Just Hate It" strategy has reportedly sent shockwaves through the ETF industry. Fund
managers, who
spent
countless hours developing sophisticated strategies involving futures contracts and
other
instruments, are now
questioning
their life choices.

"We built complex models! We backtested everything! We even hired a shaman to bless the servers!"
exclaimed
one visibly
distraught
ETF provider. "And it turns out all we needed to do was put out a fund called 'The 'ETH Will Fail' Fund
(CRYPTO:
DOOOM)' and watch the money roll in."

## Recommendations for Future Success

For those looking to replicate this year's top-performing strategy, the report offers some key
recommendations:

1.  Cultivate a genuine and unwavering belief that Ethereum is fundamentally flawed and destined for
    obsolescence.
2.  Spend at least 30 minutes daily engaging in negative affirmations about smart contracts and gas fees.
3.  Consider setting up a small altar dedicated to theInverse Cramer ETF for
    inspiration
    .
4.  Invest heavily in ETH-shorting ETFs.
5.  Practice a sneering, condescending laugh for when someone asks you about your investment strategy.

While the long-term viability of a strategy based purely on negativity and spite remains to be seen, for
now,
it seems the best way to make money in crypto was simply to root for the other team's spectacular failure.
