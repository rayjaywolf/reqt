*Breaking news from a city that's really leaning into the bit*

**Ljubljana Declares Itself World's Most Crypto-Friendly City, Immediately Replaces All Pigeons with Bitcoin ATMs**

LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA – In a bold move solidifying its position atop the global "Crypto-Friendly Cities Index," the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana has reportedly replaced its entire pigeon population with state-of-the-art Bitcoin ATMs. The city, already lauded for its widespread crypto adoption and a shopping center affectionately dubbed "Bitcoin City," claims the initiative is the natural next step in fully integrating digital currency into the urban landscape.

"Why have feathered creatures cooing and leaving droppings when we can have sleek, silent machines dispensing the future of finance?" asked Mayor Zoran Janković, unveiling a shimmering new Bitcoin ATM perched precariously on a statue of a beloved Slovenian poet. "This is about progress. This is about embracing the digital age with open wings... or, rather, with secure private keys."

## A City Transformed

The transition, which reportedly happened overnight with surprising efficiency and zero public consultation, has left some residents bewildered. "I used to feed the pigeons my stale bread," muttered eighty-year-old Marjeta, looking forlornly at a cold, metallic dispenser. "Now what am I supposed to do? Try to explain proof-of-work to a machine?"

Tourists have also noted the change. "I came to Ljubljana for the charming bridges and the picturesque old town," said American traveler Brad, staring at a row of humming ATMs where a flock of pigeons once gave me a heart attack by suddenly taking flight. "I guess you can buy a coffee with crypto now, but where's the local color? Unless you count the faint glow of the ATM screens."

## The Economic Impact (Probably)

City officials remain unfazed, highlighting the economic benefits. "Think of the possibilities! No more pigeon-related cleaning costs!" exclaimed a city spokesperson, narrowly dodging a rogue 'quinho' that had apparently not yet been converted. "Plus, we anticipate a significant boost in 'Satoshi Tourism,' where crypto enthusiasts flock to witness our pioneering urban ecosystem."

While the city is basking in its new, undeniably digital glory, whispers of discontent are beginning to surface, particularly concerning the logistics of the sudden avian-to-ATM conversion. Unconfirmed reports suggest a "slight backlog" at the city's former main square, now a bustling hub of whirring machinery and confused-looking tourists clutching small denominations of fiat currency.

## The Future is... Taxable?

Adding another layer of typically Slovenian pragmatism to the situation, sources indicate that the city is already exploring a potential "transaction fee" for anyone attempting to interact with the new ATM- замість-pigeon network using traditional methods, citing the "environmental cost of handling outdated physical tender." Meanwhile, plans for a city-wide airdrop of a new token, tentatively named "LjubljanaCoin (LPN)," are reportedly on hold until they can figure out how to program the ATMs to distribute it without attracting actual birds.

Stay tuned as Ljubljana continues its ambitious, and some might say baffling, journey into becoming the world's first truly pigeon-free, ATM-saturated metropolis.
