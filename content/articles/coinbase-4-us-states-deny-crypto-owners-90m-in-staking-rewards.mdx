**Noble States Shield Citizens From Accidental Wealth Through Cryptocurrency 'Staking'**

In a stunning display of paternalistic governance, the states of California, New Jersey, Maryland, and Wisconsin have successfully prevented their residents from inadvertently accumulating an estimated $90 million in cryptocurrency staking rewards via the Coinbase platform. Authorities in these states
reportedly
acted to protect citizens from the perplexing concept of earning passive income through digital assets they may not fully understand, effectively keeping them safe from the dangers of unexpected financial gains.

The move comes amidst ongoing
regulatory
confusion surrounding cryptocurrency, which officials admit is "just a lot of internet money nobody really gets." By denying access to staking, the states have
heroically
simplified the financial lives of millions, ensuring they won't be
burdened
with the
complexities
of receiving
additional
returns on their digital holdings.

## The Peril of Passive Income

Sources close to the regulatory bodies
indicated
that the decision was made in the best interest of residents, who might be
overwhelmed
by the prospect of their crypto simply *doing something* without their direct
intervention
. "Imagine the chaos," stated a
fictional
spokesperson for the coalition of states,
straightening
a tie that
appeared
to be made of red tape. "People waking up to more money in their accounts, not knowing where it came from, what it means, or if they owe taxes on it. It's a
recipe
for widespread panic and possibly spontaneous interpretive dance."

The estimated $90 million in foregone rewards is seen by state officials not as lost opportunity, but as a
successful
prevention of potential confusion and the
unnecessary
stress of having slightly more wealth.

## Coinbase Expresses Mild Disappointment

Coinbase, the platform at the center of the
controversy
, issued a statement expressing its mild
disappointment
that users in these states are unable to participate in staking. The company
reiterated
its belief that earning rewards on crypto is a positive thing, but
acknowledged
that navigating the
diverse
and sometimes
whimsical
regulatory landscapes of individual US states is "more challenging than explaining blockchain to your
grandparents
at Thanksgiving dinner."

Affected users, meanwhile,
expressed
a range of emotions, from
resignation
to a vague sense of being protected from something they didn't
realize
was dangerous. "I guess it's for the best,"
sighed
one California resident,
staring
blankly at their crypto balance, which had not mysteriously
increased
overnight. "I probably would have just wasted that $50 in staking rewards on something
frivolous
, like groceries or not living in constant fear of gas prices."

While other states have
allowed
staking to continue, these four
remain
steadfast in their commitment to shielding their residents from the potential pitfalls of earning free money through
decentralized
networks. The $90 million will presumably be held in a large,
undisclosed
vault,
safely
out of reach of anyone who might accidentally benefit from it.
