**Ohio Unveils Plan to Accept Crypto for State Fees, Anticipates 'Mild Chaos' and 'Potentially Historic Windfalls (for Someone)'**

COLUMBUS, OH – In a bold leap into a future nobody in government seems to fully understand, the state of Ohio has announced plans to allow residents to pay a wide range of state and local fees using the
unpredictable
whirlwind of cryptocurrency. The initiative,
hailed
by proponents as
innovative
and by
skeptics
as a potential administrative
nightmare
fueled by laser-eyed degens, is expected to roll out sometime before the heat death of the universe, or possibly next Tuesday, depending on blockchain congestion.

According to sources deep within the Ohio state bureaucracy – presumably the same ones still trying to figure out fax machines – residents will soon be able to settle everything from traffic tickets to marriage license applications with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a select few other digital tokens deemed " sufficiently cool" by a newly formed state subcommittee of alleged crypto experts (their main qualification being they once successfully bought an NFT).

## A New Era of Volatile Payments

The move is
anticipated
to introduce a thrilling new element of chance to the previously mundane act of paying government fees. Officials are reportedly
preparing
for scenarios where a resident
attempts
to pay a $50 late fee with Ethereum, only for the value to
double
by the time the transaction confirms,
resulting
in the state
accidentally
collecting enough to
repave
a small
section
of road. Conversely, a sudden market crash could see the same transaction cover only the
administrative
cost of processing the failed payment.

"We see this as an opportunity to truly embrace innovation and also
potentially
acquire a vast,
unpredictable
treasure trove of digital assets,"
stated
Ohio's newly appointed Director of Digital Coin Collection, who
insisted
on being
paid
for the interview in Dogecoin. "It's a win-win. Residents get the convenience of using their favorite internet money, and the state gets... well, whatever that internet money happens to be worth at that exact nanosecond."

## Bureaucracy Meets the Blockchain

Training for state employees tasked with
processing
crypto payments is reportedly underway,
involving
intense seminars on topics such as "What in God's Name is a Wallet Address?" and "How to Explain a 50% Price Drop to Your Supervisor Without Crying." The state has also
contracted
with a third-party processor, whose main piece of
technology
is rumored to be a large,
anxious-looking
hamster on a wheel
connected
to a series of increasingly
outdated
computers.

Critics, primarily
consisting
of anyone who has ever
attempted
to navigate a government website or
understand
gas fees,
warn
of
impending
chaos. "Imagine trying to contest a parking ticket when the value of your payment token is
fluctuating
wildly,"
mused
one
skeptical
citizen. "Will the fine change mid-argument? Will I
suddenly
owe the city a fraction of a Shiba Inu coin?"

Despite the
potential
for
hilarity
and financial
unpredictability
, Ohio remains committed to its crypto fee collection plan. Future phases reportedly include
accepting
meme coins for vehicle registration and allowing residents to pay property taxes with a
complex
basket of
altcoins
selected based on astrological charts. The state
encourages
residents to begin
accumulating
their preferred cryptocurrencies now,
advising
them to "maybe buy a little extra, just in case the price tanks while you're trying to pay that
dog license
fee."
